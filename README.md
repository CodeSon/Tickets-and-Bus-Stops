# Tickets-and-Bus-Stops
### Real-time Bus Tracking System
Bus Locator is an end-to-end Python-based real-time bus tracking application and passenger validation system that handles the entire workflow from data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), to displaying the location of buses in Stockholm, Sweden. 
1. This project fetches data from various bus station databases, integrating with the Google Geocoding API for precise location data.
2. APC simulating number of passengers at each stop.
3. Ticket types and Passenger Validation.
4. Generating a CSV file and an Excel spreadsheet with the collected data and finally importing the data into Power BI for Data modelling then analysis/Visualisation.

### Technologies Used:
* Python
* Google Geocoding API
* Pandas library for ETL and data manipulation
* Requests library for API calls.

### Features:

Implements an end-to-end real-time tracking of bus locations in Stockholm.
Showcases effective ETL processes: Extracts data from multiple bus station databases, Transforms the collected data using Python and the pandas library, and Loads the data into CSV and Excel files for further analysis.
